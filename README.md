# Homework 3
## ECE 6460: VSLI - Design Automation

Implement the slicing tree sizing algorithm, which takes
a floorplan topology and a list of possible shapes for each
module and computes the optimal area for the floorplan using the 
algorithm discussed in class and also in Example 3.4 in the
textbook. In order for this procedure to be used in the simulated
annealing, use normalized polish expression to describe the
topology in the input. Name your routine as cost() that takes a NPE
as its input.
